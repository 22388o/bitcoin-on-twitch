Accept Bitcoin donations on Twitch, and integrate them into your alerts!

# Contributing
I want this to be a project that allows streamers on Twitch to integrate Bitcoin donations  
into their on-stream alerts with as little setup as possible. What I would like to automate:  
1. Installation of LNbits – pretty simple
1. Setting up the Streamlabs API; retreiving a token – more or less trivial
1. Setting up the webhook (LNbits -> webhook -> Streamlabs) – I've already done this for myself, so trivial as well  

I'm not at all used to maintaining projects with other contributors, so I don't know, just follow the  
common etiquette or whatever if you wanna help :)  
I would especially appreciate help with just making things cleaner and more efficient (I'm not a professional),  
as well as potentially integrating services other than Streamlabs (not sure if there are any  
that are widely used like Streamlabs and actually have an API for this).
